# Obstacle Avoidance Robot

### Project Description
The obstacle avoidance robot was built as a DIY project, implementing obstacle avoidance algorithms using HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. The project features a custom PCB, which was etched by hand to suit the electronic system requirements. The robot moves autonomously, analyzing its surroundings and making decisions to change direction when obstacles are detected.

### Features
Custom PCB: The PCB was designed and etched by hand to fit the specific needs of the project.
Ultrasonic Sensors: The robot uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in its path.
Autonomous Navigation: The robot is capable of navigating autonomously, adjusting its movement to avoid collisions with objects.
Simple and Scalable Design: The design is modular and can be expanded with additional sensors or functionalities.
