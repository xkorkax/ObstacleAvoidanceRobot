# Obstacle Avoidance Robot

## Project Description
The obstacle avoidance robot was built as a DIY project, implementing obstacle avoidance algorithms using ultrasonic sensors. The project features a custom PCB, which was etched by hand to suit the electronic system requirements. The robot moves autonomously, analyzing its surroundings and making decisions to change direction when obstacles are detected.
